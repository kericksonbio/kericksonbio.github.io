          <h3> Teaching Philosophy </h3>
          <p>I have spent my whole life helping others learn. From my first volunteering
            experience of writing books for people learning to read as teenagers, to teaching swim lessons, 
            to teaching computer science to incarcerated woman and mentoring undergraduates to pursue independent
            research projects, I've always found ways to share the things that I love doing to people of 
            all backgrounds. My teaching ethos is informed by both my personal experiences relating to learners
            as well as my pursuit of coursework during my undergraduate to understand the sociological factors that
            impact student in american education systems as well as the best practices to teach STEM disciplines. 
            As a laboratory technician and graduate researcher, I have mentored dozens of students to learn molecular 
            biology lab skills and make meaningful contributions to research. As a teaching assistant, I build supportive
            and welcoming environments for all students that make me an approachable and effective TA.

          <h3> Teaching Evaluations </h3>
          <p class="eval"> "Katie is an exemplary TA. 
            Discussion, where a lot of students aren't interested in being there, is so incredibly hard to teach and command a room and Katie did that. 
            If I was confused about a homework problem, I knew that going to discussion would clear it up. 
            It seems like they had the perfect words that would help me understand the harder concepts of evolution. 
            She was also incredibly generous and kind when students would have difficulty. 
            They are everything you want in a TA, and the university is so lucky to have them."</p>

          <br>
          <p class="eval"> "Katie was a very great TA for this course and led the discussions very well. 
          She clearly cares about her students' success and was great at responding to the questions 
          or discussion points students would bring up throughout the class. 
          She was very approachable."</p>
